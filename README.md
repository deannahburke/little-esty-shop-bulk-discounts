# Bulk Discounts

## Module 2 Final Solo Project by: Deannah Burke 

"Bulk Discounts" builds upon existing code from a group project titled ["Little Esty Shop"](https://github.com/NickJacobsss/little-esty-shop), a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. Bulk Discounts adds a new table to the existing database and adds functionality for merchants to add discounts to their items.
